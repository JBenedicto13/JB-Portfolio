        <h1 className="p-title">The Big Five Student Leadership Skills: The CEO Mindset</h1>
        <div className="p-content">
            <ul className="p-content-list">
                <li>
                    <h2>Vision</h2>
                    <p>Think Like an Owner, Not a Passenger CEOs don&apos;t wait to be told where to go. They decide.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Communication</h2>
                    <p>Your Ideas Are Only as Good as How You Express Them The most brilliant person in the room loses to the one who communicates clearly. Public speaking, writing, listening — these are career superpowers.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Collaboration</h2>
                    <p>No CEO Runs Alone Leadership isn&apos;t about being on top — it&apos;s about bringing people with you. Learning to work with different personalities is a skill most people underestimate until they&apos;re in the workplace.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Resilience</h2>
                    <p>The Skill They Don&apos;t Grade in School You will fail. Your plans will change. The job market will surprise you. The CEOs who last aren&apos;t the ones who never fall — they&apos;re the ones who get up faster.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Self-Awareness</h2>
                    <p>Know Your Strengths, Know Your Gaps The best leaders know what they&apos;re great at and who to surround themselves with to cover the rest. This starts with honest reflection — something most students skip.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2 className="p-content-quote">A CEO mindset doesn&apos;t mean you want to run a company. It means you take ownership of your life, your choices, and your growth — starting now, not after graduation.</h2>
